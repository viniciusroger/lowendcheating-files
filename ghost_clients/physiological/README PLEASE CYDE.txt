 Virus detection explanation: 
1️⃣ the login system was made using keyauth, an "open source". Actually a part of it is obfuscated, and cause of that virus total alerts count goes up to 5. 
2️⃣ the code has been partially obfuscated that makes the flags counter increase
3️⃣ some functions that detects when the mouse key or a key is held down to toggle the clicker makes it flag as keylogger
4️⃣ in "relations" you'll see 2 flags related to "Siticone.UI.dll" that's just a framework used to code the clicker's UI. This file will be extracted from the .exe directly into the folder Physiological Remake is located

 IPs detection explanation: 
Virus Total shows that Physiological Remake has a relation with different IP's. Obviously this is for the login system, if you want to check the IP's yourself, copy and track them on https://www.iplocation.net/ . You will find out most of them are linked to Microsoft, Cloudflare etc..
