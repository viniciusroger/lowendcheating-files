              IMPORTANT 

  *  When you start the autoclicker, you
     will no longer be able to change any
     of the settings. This is a limitation
     of the code. If you want to change your
     settings at any point, you will need
     to press the stop button which will
     stop the autoclicker and you will be
     able to change the cps values again.

  *  If you hear any beeping while using 
     this, just ignore it. Its an invalid
     input.

  *  To bypass any screenshare, close Void
     Clicker, run the Self-Destruct.bat file
     , click on Void Clicker and press the
     "shift" + "delete" keys, at once.
=========================================
            VERY IMPORTANT 
  *  YOU MUST START THE CLICKER BEFORE 
     YOU CAN TOGGLE IT ON

  *  IF THE CLICKER STARTS, THEN FLASHES
     TEXT, THEN CLOSES DO THIS TO FIX IT:
     OPEN SETTINGS > UPDATE & SECURITY > 
     WINDOWS SECURITY > VIRUS & THREAT
     PROTECTION > OPEN THE CLICKER > PRESS
     "V" > WINDOWS WILL DETECT A THREAT >
     CLICK ON IT > SELECT "ALLOW ON DEVICE"
     > THEN PRESS THE "START ACTIONS" 
     BUTTON. Windows detects this as a virus
     because the way it was coded. This is
     called a "false positive". Please
     don't hesitate to contact me on 
     Discord for any questions or concerns.
